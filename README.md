## Description

The AI Interviewer App is an innovative platform that allows users to prepare for tech job interviews. By using artificial intelligence, the app customizes interview questions based on the user's input and provides feedback based on the answers given. This application is designed to help users prepare for tech roles by simulating real interview scenarios.

### Key Features:
- **User Authentication**: Sign in and create an account.
- **Interview Preparation**: Users can specify the job role they want to specialize in.
- **AI-Generated Questions**: Based on the user's input, AI generates relevant interview questions.
- **Feedback Generation**: The app generates personalized feedback based on the answers provided by the user during the interview.
- **Voice Integration**: Users can interact with the AI interviewer using voice commands, powered by VAPI (Voice API).

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - **React.js**: Used for building the user interface.
  - **TypeScript**: For type safety and better development experience.

- **Backend**: 
  - **Node.js**: Server-side runtime environment for handling API requests and user interactions.
  - **Express**: Framework for creating the backend routes and handling HTTP requests.

- **Database**: 
  - **Firestore**: NoSQL database for storing user data and interview-related information.

- **APIs**:
  - **VAPI (Voice API)**: For enabling voice interaction with the AI interviewer.
